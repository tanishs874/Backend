// INTERNET

Message from mobile phone is transferred in the forms of packets to the nearest tower -->
--> then the data gets converted to electrical signals -->
--> then the message will be transferred through wires under the sea -->
--> and then the electrical signals will reach the nearest tower of the receiver's end -->
--> then the tower will convert the electrical signals to packets -->
--> then the message will be recived by receiver


// ROUTER

Router has MAC Adress of every connected device..
--> In the earlier times a hacker can change the MAC address to the other's MAC address and can receive all the messages that are sent to the user's MAC address
--> But nowdays there is end to end encrytption in which you have a shared key on the basis of shared key your message is decrypted

// Question--> Can we say if any computer which is connected to the INTERNET and is programmed to receive request and give response back is called a server?

--> YES 

http --> hyper text transfer protocol

https --> hyper text transfer protocol secure

--> WE cannot send or recive anything without http and https

--> Date ka ana jana http or https taye karta hai ..

--> All the ISP(Internet Service Provider) have to follow all the rules of Internet.

http --> Not Secured --> Data can be monitored or hacked in these websites 
https --> Secured -> We cannot read the data because it is encrypted.

To get connected with a server we use ports ..
Ports can be closed and open
